          <h2 align="center">What drives me</h2>
          <p class="alignment">I have a passion to positively contribute to the professional and personal development of people I interact and work with. The need to be the best and suceed in anything I put my mind to is the reason I wake up every morning. Knowing what I
            want professionally with respect to growth provides a bearing for me. Key values that I hold dear are honesty, integrity, compassion, hard-work, respect for diversity, punctuality and many more positive things. I have a dream that one day
            technology will have diffused into every household in my country as we embrace the benefits of development.
